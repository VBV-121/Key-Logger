# Key-Logger

<b> What is a Key Logger ?</b><br/>
A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is software that tracks or logs the keys struck on your 
keyboard, typically in a covert manner so that you don't know that your actions are being monitored.
<br/>

The main objective of keyloggers is to interfere in the chain of events that happen when a key is 
pressed and when the data is displayed on the monitor as a result of a keystroke. A keylogger can be 
done by introducing a wiring or a hardware bug in the keyboard, to achieve video surveillance, terminating 
input and/or output, or by also implementing the use of a filter driver in the keyboard stack and demanding 
data from the user's keyboard using generalized documented methods. There are two other rootkit methods used 
by hackers: masking in kernel mode and masking in user mode.
